# HTML Form Projects

This repository contains three simple HTML projects: Event Registration Form, Job Application Form, and Personal Information Form. Each project is designed to demonstrate basic HTML form elements and their usage.

## Event Registration Form

The Event Registration Form is a basic form for users to register for an event. It includes common form fields such as name, email, and event preferences.

## Job Application Form

The Job Application Form is a simple form for job seekers to submit their basic information, education, and work experience.

## Personal Information Form

The Personal Information Form collects basic personal details, such as name, address, and contact information.

## How to Use

1. Open the respective HTML file for the form you want to explore (`event_registration_form.html`, `job_application_form.html`, `personal_information_form.html`).
2. Fill out the form fields as required.
3. Submit the form to see how the data is processed (Note: Front-end only, no server-side processing in these projects).


Happy coding!
